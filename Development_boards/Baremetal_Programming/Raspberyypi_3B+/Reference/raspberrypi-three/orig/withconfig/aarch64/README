The aarch64 directory examples require both the kernel8.img file and
the config.txt file in the root directory of the sd card (along with
bootcode.bin and start.elf).

Most if not all you will want a 3.3v uart solution like an ftdi
breakout board.  RX to TX and TX to RX.  115200 8N1

The bootloader from bootloader10 is included in this directory as
bootloader.img along with the same config.txt file used in all the
examples.  Copy bootloader.img to kernel8.img on the sd card.  It
supports motorola s-record files being downloaded.  If using minicom
use an ascii file transfer to download the notmain.srec file and then
enter g to go (see the bootloader10 source if this doesnt make
sense).

I am not going to blink the LED on the pi3 as it is not directly
connected to a GPIO pin, instead the blinker examples are goign to use
the uart and toggle GPIO pin 21 that you can monitor with an LED (and
resistor) of your own, or a voltmeter or scope.



MIDR shows 0x410FD034 so this is a r0p4 device (use the correct/matching
documentation)
