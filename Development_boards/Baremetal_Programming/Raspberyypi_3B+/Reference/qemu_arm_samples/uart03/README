This is derived from uart02.

Since we can cheat we can take advantage of that.  So if I write to the
data register (send a byte out) then read the status.  I could
make this code tighter but the status register shows that the tx buffer
is empty already.  Thats fine we can still poll for it, I was worried
we might have to do more to setup the uart.  Now the first time I ran
this it showed there was a character in the rx buffer, it is not doing
that now, but I left the read from DR in there in the uart_init() just
in case.

This program goes on to an infinite loop that waits for characters
from the console and echos them back out.  So what you type you get
back.  Basically we can use the RXFF status bit to see that there is
a byte, and when we get that byte we can send it out.
