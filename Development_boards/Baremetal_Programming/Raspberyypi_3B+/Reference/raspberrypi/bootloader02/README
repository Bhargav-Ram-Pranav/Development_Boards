See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

Derived from uart02, this is a very simple bootloader.  Instead of the
sd dance (see toplevel README), this makes life a bit simpler and greatly
reduces physical wear and tear on the sd card socket.  Do the sd card
dance one time with kernel.img.  Get some sort of serial solution to
connect a dumb termial program (minicom, hyperterm, etc) to the uart on
the raspberry pi. (see toplevel README)

The difference between bootloader01 and bootloader02 is that this one
uses xmodem.  So you take the .bin file of your test program, assumed
to be built based on address 0 and less than 0x200000 bytes.

This bootloader sits at 0x200000 so that you have 0x200000 bytes to
develop with.  And that way if you like your program you can just
copy a .bin version to kernel.img on the sd card and use it.  Fairly
easy to change this address.  bootloader02.c and novectors.s each have
a copy of this value.

bootloader01 uses .hex files, bootloader02 uses .bin files dont send it
.hex files, wont work.
