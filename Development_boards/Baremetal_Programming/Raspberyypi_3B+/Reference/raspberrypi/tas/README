This is a thumb assembler derived directly from the assembler in my
thumbulator project.  The thumulator version remains the primary
version/home.

I added the .include directive in the original thumbulator this one has
a base address, still flushing that out.

This is headed towards a learn assembly tutorial using this easy to
compile tool if building binutils is not working for you or too
intimidating right now.  Also binutils separates assemble and link
and linker scripts are a programming language themselves.

by adding .include things like the little bit of arm code needed to
get you into thumb mode.  And a pre-compiled implementation of hexstring
and uart_init so you dont have to have tools or understand how that
code works to get started in the environment I invision for a learn
asm tutorial.

If you dont have anything to talk to the uart (see top level readme)
then the blinker example should work at a minimum

./tas blinker01.s

gives you blinker01.s.bin which you should be able to copy to kernel.img
on your sd card and when you power cycle it should come up and blink the
led.
