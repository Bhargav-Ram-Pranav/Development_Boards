See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

This example is for the pi zero, see other directories for other flavors
of raspberry pi.

This is derived from blinker04.

I dont understand why but way too many blinker examples use interrupts.
In short only use interrupts if you have to, often you dont have to.
If you feel you have to this example shows you a little about enabling
and handling interrupts on a raspberry pi.

Interrupts are an advanced programming topic, no matter how simple
this example makes it appear, there is a long list of things that can
and will go wrong.  I definitely didnt get this working on the first
or second or third try.  It took many.  Fortunately on this system
we have a few layers we can play with before actually interrupting
the processor.  This is both a blessing and a curse, some systems
have a number of layers, not all easy to find in the docs if in the
docs and all layers have to have the right enables, etc to route the
interrupt from the peripheral to processor.  blinker04 showed a timer
with a raw interrupt status register, basically the interrupt signal
near its source.  The interrupt enable bit on the timer is the first
layer you have to enable the signal through.  This example kills three
birds with one stone.  Instead of three examples I enable one layer at
a time and show a few blinks with each layer before completely
connecting the interrupt to the processor.

The first problem we have with the raspberry pi is where the binary
is loaded.  I have had the most success by not mucking with settings
which means that our program is loaded at address 0x8000.  For this
ARM core to service an interrupt we need to have our exception table at
address 0x0000 (newer cores we can move that address).

If you have been reading your ARM documents as you should by this point
you will know that for an interrupt on this processor it executes the
instruction at address 0x0001C.  Also the interrupt mode has a different
r13 or stack pointer than supervisor mode.  So if we plan to use the
stack at all in the interrupt handler we need to prepare that stack
pointer before any interrupts come along.

Before we get to the stack pointer, looking at vectors.s.  We know that
0x8000 is our entry point where _start will be.  We know that is not the
exception table but I have made one there anyway, why?  There are a
number of ways to do this, this way we get the assembler/linker to do
some of the work for us.  Using the ldr pc,label instruction I am
letting the assembler do the work of creating the machine code for a
relative load.

Address 0x8000 loads into the program counter (same as doing a branch if
you are not switching modes) the address contained at address 0x8020
which is filled in (by the assembler) the address for the reset label.
This repeats one for one for 8 handlers 0x8004 gets address in 0x8024,
etc.  I happen to know and you can look up the fact that ldr pc,label
when used this way uses relative addressing

    8000:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8020 <reset_handler>
    ...
00008020 <reset_handler>:
    8020:   00008040

The machine instruction 0xe59ff018 when placed at address 0x1000 will
read from address 0x1000+0x20, basically pc+0x20 (the disassembly is
misleading).  So if I were to copy the instruction at 0x8000 to 0x0000
and the address at 0x8020 to 0x0020, then it still works, a reset
exception if we could create one would read 0x8040 in this case and put
that in the pc, causing a jump to 0x8040.  Same is true for all 8
instructions and all 8 addresses.  So the first thing the code does
after reset is copy those 16 words from 0x8000 to 0x0000, we didnt have
to figure out addresses for functions and didnt have to generate machine
code this approach let the assembler do the work.


This code copies 16 32 bit values from 0x8000 to 0x0000

    mov r0,#0x8000
    mov r1,#0x0000
    ldmia r0!,{r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,r9}
    stmia r1!,{r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,r9}
    ldmia r0!,{r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,r9}
    stmia r1!,{r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,r9}

Which are the 8 exception entry points and the 8 handler addresses

00008000 <_start>:
    8000:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8020 <reset_handler>
    8004:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8024 <undefined_handler>
    8008:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8028 <swi_handler>
    800c:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 802c <prefetch_handler>
    8010:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8030 <data_handler>
    8014:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8034 <unused_handler>
    8018:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8038 <irq_handler>
    801c:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 803c <fiq_handler>

00008020 <reset_handler>:
    8020:   00008040

00008024 <undefined_handler>:
    8024:   00008080

00008028 <swi_handler>:
    8028:   00008080

0000802c <prefetch_handler>:
    802c:   00008080

00008030 <data_handler>:
    8030:   00008080

00008034 <unused_handler>:
    8034:   00008080

00008038 <irq_handler>:
    8038:   000080a8

0000803c <fiq_handler>:
    803c:   00008080

The next thing the reset code does is set up the stack pointer, not
much different than the other example programs except in this case
we need to setup both the supervisor mode, which we normally run
these examples in, and interrupt mode.  The modes determine which
registers are used, the stack pointer being one that has a different
register for each mode.  The trick is to use the mrs instruction to
change some of the bits in the program status register (psr) the bits
in particular we care about are the mode bits.  Change the mode to
interrupt, set the interrupt stack pointer, change the mode back to
supervisor and change the stack pointer, then continue by calling the
entry C function, notmain().

I actually did IRQ mode, FIQ mode and SVC mode.

    ;@ (PSR_IRQ_MODE|PSR_FIQ_DIS|PSR_IRQ_DIS)
    mov r0,#0xD2
    msr cpsr_c,r0
    mov sp,#0x8000

    ;@ (PSR_FIQ_MODE|PSR_FIQ_DIS|PSR_IRQ_DIS)
    mov r0,#0xD1
    msr cpsr_c,r0
    mov sp,#0x4000

    ;@ (PSR_SVC_MODE|PSR_FIQ_DIS|PSR_IRQ_DIS)
    mov r0,#0xD3
    msr cpsr_c,r0
    mov sp,#0x8000000

Note on the pi2 and pi3 which have an ARMv7 and ARMv8 cores respectively
not only can you change the address where the exception table is
(rather than setting one up at 0x00000000) but as of this writing they
are both natively (with no config.txt) booted into HYP mode which
is difficult to get out of, so the notion of multiple modes in that
situation isnt there.  The processors support this different mode thing
but you have to take over control of booting of the cores (config.txt).
I point this out for your education, ARMv4, ARMv5 and ARMv6, the ARM7
through the ARM11 you use modes, after that the Cortex-As can use
the legacy modes or can use new features.

Just like blinker04, blinker05 configures the gpio pin for driving the
led and sets up the timer.  Different from blinker04, interrupts are
enabled in the control register (bit 5).  Using the assumption that this
program was run just after reset, either as kernel.img on the sd card
or using one of my bootloaders that doesnt mess with enabling interrupts,
etc. The interrupt will leave the timer but get stopped at the next layer.
Since it is leaving the timer we will be able to see it in the masked
interrupt status register.  So the first blinks, once state change
per second, are based on polling the MIS register.

The next layer is between the timer and the ARM.  Each chip vendor and
model can vary wildly as to how many layers and how to use them.  In
this case we have a relatively simple interrupt enable.  By setting
a bit in the irq enable register we are allowing the ARM timer interrupt
to pass through to the ARM core.  Because our early cpsr registers
manipulation (to set up the interrupt stack) forced the interrupt
enable for the ARM core to a one, ARM core interrupts are disabled.
The next blinks at 2 seconds per state change poll the interrupt
status register at this layer.

The last step is to enable the interrupts to the ARM core by changing
the I bit in the cpsr to a zero.  Because we had prepared the exception
table when the interrupt comes the code at address 0x1C is executed
which eventually hits the c_irq_handler function, remember this is
an interrupt handler, you are soemwhat running parallel.  Dont take
very long and dont mess with resources in use by the foreground
application.  Typically you want to be in and out fast.  At some
point in the isr you need to clear the source of the isr.  Which we
learned while experimenting with polling so that we didnt have to
figure it out while developing the interrupt.



Note something not obvious here but worth stating, it is good to get
the uart up before venturing into the interrupt realm.  You can print
what you are polling to see what is going on.  For example if you
look in the interrupt section of the Broadcom manual they talk about
this basic register and interrupts that come into it from the GPU
and ARM.  Prior knowledge from prior examples we can control the timer
and have it roll over at some number of seconds.  So we can enable
the interrupt through and poll this irq basic register and see what
if any bits change and if any change and stay changed after the
amount of time we set the timer for, that might be our interrupt bit.
Having the uart working we can poll and print changes if/when they
arrive, without the uart working we hope the documentation is right
the polling example here can and does confirm that for us, but there
are other interrupts in this chip that you may have to hack your
way through, or read the linux port, or figure out some other way.
Without the uart is more difficult.
