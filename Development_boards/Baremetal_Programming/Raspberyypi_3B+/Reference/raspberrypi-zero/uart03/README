See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

This is a simple uart example for the pi zero.

Based on uart02, the difference is that this is primarily thumb code
instead of ARM.  ARM in this case meaning the traditional 32 bit
instruction set and thumb meaning the traditional 16 bit instruction
subset.

Note this core does not support the thumb2 extensions.

See the top level README for information on how to connect the raspi
uart to your host computer.
