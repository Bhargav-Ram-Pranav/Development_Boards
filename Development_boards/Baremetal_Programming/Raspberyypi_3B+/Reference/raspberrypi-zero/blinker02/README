See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

This example is for the pi zero

There is a free-running 64 bit timer, super easy to use, just read it.

//0x01000000 17 seconds
//0x00400000 4 seconds
//#define TIMER_BIT 0x01000000
#define TIMER_BIT 0x00400000

There is a 250MHz system clock, my guess is this is divided by 256 to
get 977KHz.  0x01000000 ticks would be 17.18 seconds, I am using a
watch with a second hand to measure this.  Seems plausible that is
what is going on with this timer.

Can change the TIMER_BIT to a different one to change the blink rate
of the LED for example try:

#define TIMER_BIT 0x00100000
