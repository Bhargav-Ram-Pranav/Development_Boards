Simlar to blinker02 except this uses a very simple timer in the chip
but outside the arm core.  One of the on chip peripherals.

This is a 16 bit timer with a 16 bit prescaler.  No change to the
system clock so 8000000/0xFFFF is 122 timer ticks per second.

See the README for blinker02.  If running this in sram, and the
flash that booted the processor modified the clock speeds, the blink
rate may not match the above description.
