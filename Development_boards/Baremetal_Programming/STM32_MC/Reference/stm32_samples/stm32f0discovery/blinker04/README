See the top level README for schematic and programmers reference information.

Same as blinker03 except it switches to the external clock first.

The schematic shows that the external clock is 8MHz, so we have to wonder
if we really switched or not since the internal clock is also 8MHz.
Unlike the prior examples, for this example even if the flash program
that boots the processor changes the clocks, this program by
selecting the external, should blink the led based on an 8MHz clock
speed no matter what.
