PA9 is USART1_TX alternate function 1
PA10 is USART1_RX alternate function 1

This example switches to the external 8MHz clock.  Enables port A,
enables the uart.  Then it switches PA9 to alternate function 1.  What
that means is that there are many peripherals or features within this
chip, more features than we necessarily have pins for.  So what
they have done here is not that unusual, they have a way to switch
the connection between the pin and some number of peripherals in the
chip.  This in now way means that you can connect any peripheral
signal to any pin.  The pins basically power up connected to what is
called GPIO, or general purpose input/output, for blinking leds for
example.  In this case we want to connect one of the possible uart
outputs to one of the pins, so I have chosen USART1_TX on PA9.  This
example does TX only so we dont need to to mess with USART1_RX until a
later example.

The uart is setup for 115200 baud, 8000000Hz/115200 = 69.4, so basically
the main clock is divided by 69 and a fraction to get that speed.
Usually you want to have an additional divide by 16 so that the
receiver can oversample the input, but we cant get up to 115200 from
8MHz doing that.  Later with a faster system clock we can do something
different.

This example blasts the characters 0123456701234567... forever as
fast as it can.  If using minicom you need to alt-a then w to switch
to wraparound mode so you can see them.
