This example uses PA9 AF1 as USART1_TX.
This example uses PA10 AF1 as USART1_RX (not really used)

I did a search on ebay for ssd1306 and found some white 0.96" 128x64 I2C
OLED LCD display modules.

I have a raspberry pi example that uses spi on a sparkfun display that
is smaller that uses the ssd1306.  So I lifted the list of commands
and stuff from that and replaced the spi command and data writes with
i2c command and data writes.
