information.

This example uses the spi interface with a three color epaper display

I did learn from their example programs in order to create this program.
They do not document the LUT data.

Unlike the 1.54 inch three color the interface is a bit easier to program
but...it blinks forever getting the image there.  It is nice to not
to have to program twice the number of pixels for the black layer.
