This example uses the spi interface with a three color epaper display

I did learn from their example programs in order to create this program.
They do not document the LUT data.

It blinks a lot and takes a while to update, the blinks get the black
set then the red comes in slowly.

With the wires up, the first pixel/data sent is top left corner and
goes across the top.

From a black (and white) perspective it is 400 wide by 200 tall, but
you have to have matching pairs of pixels 00b = black 11b = white

The red (and white) layer is 200 wide by 200 wide 1 is white 0 is red.
