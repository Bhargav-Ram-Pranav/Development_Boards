This example uses the spi interface with a two color epaper display

I did learn from their example programs in order to create this program.
They do not document the LUT data.

Not something you want to update all that often.  Blinks when updating.

The display is considered 296 tall and 128 wide, so wires up portrait
the data starts top left, the msbit of the first byte is the inverse
of the top left pixel.  Each byte goes across the top, 16 bytes across
then row 2 and so on.  So in landscape, wires left the first bit is the
bottom left and you draw up then to the right.

Seem to be patterns that upset it, not sure why.  It seems so far
like the even and odd rows need to be the same so instead of 296 by
128 think 148 by 128.

The LUT is something magic from them...
