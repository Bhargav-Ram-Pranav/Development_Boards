information.

This example uses the spi interface with a two color epaper display

I did learn from their example programs in order to create this program.
They do not document the LUT data.  The 2.9 and the 1.54 two color
(black and white) program the same way but with different dimensions.

Blinks when updating, for some reason they want you to do it twice.

The display is considered 200 tall and 200 wide, so wires up portrait
the data starts top left, the msbit of the first byte is the inverse
of the top left pixel.  Each byte goes across the top, 25 bytes across
then row 2 and so on.  So in landscape, wires left the first bit is the
bottom left and you draw up then to the right.

The LUT is something magic from them...
