It really bugs me when I see the blinker example you are supposed to
run first be interrupt based.  Or any notion that interrupts is how
you do that.  While true you CAN use interrupts.  It should most
definitely not be the first or fifth or 20th thing you do.  Start with
polling, you can sometimes, often?, make your entire project without
using interrupts.  Just depends some on the problem and some on your
design.  Saying that, eventually you will want/need to know.  So this
is the first interrupt example.

I am working my way to charlieplexing in the int02 example.  This
one makes the user led "glow" note how it compares to the power led.

Printing out the uart demonstrates that despite the very high interrupt
rate we are are still getting a lot of foreground time.
