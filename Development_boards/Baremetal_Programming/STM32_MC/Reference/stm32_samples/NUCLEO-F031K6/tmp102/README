See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

Got a TMP102 breakout from sparkfun.  Very very simple I like it much
better than others.

0.0625C per bit is 0.1125F per bit  which is 7373/0x10000
so multiply by 7373 and shift right 16 then add the 32
F = ((9/5)*C)+32

You like my long division, works great.


SCL on PA0
SDA on PA1

as writte can use /dev/ttyACM0 uart to see output.

#define SCL 0
#define SDA 1
