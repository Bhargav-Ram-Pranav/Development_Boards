See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

Bought some wee bitty stepper motors, I think they are used in cameras
or lenses for focusing, have screws for shafts.  Probably shouldnt
be driving them directly from the microcontroller but oh well, not
blowing up.   One coil PA0/PA1 the other PA3/PA4.
