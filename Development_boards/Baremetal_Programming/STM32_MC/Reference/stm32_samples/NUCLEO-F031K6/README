This directory contains examples for the stm32f0 nucleo board
specifically the stm32 f031k6 nucleo board.

Starting page for all of the nucleo boards

Then navigate to the NUCLEO-F031K6 page by clicking on that name in
the graph, as of this writing it is a black on yellow box.

You will need the users manual for the board.

You will need the reference manual for the specific microcontroller
(search by part number within st.com)

Unlike older/original mbed boards, it does not appear that you have
to press the reset button after copying the .bin file to run the
new program.  But, at least for me it sometimes takes a while before
the newly copied program is loaded and started in the microcontroller.

You can certainly press reset as much as you like after it is loaded
to try the new program again and again.

In the old (mbed) days the .bin file would stay there, my experience
today is that the .bin file goes away.  Historically I would choose a
specific file name (flash.bin for example) and copy to that filename on
the mbed (nucleo) device.  I think there is actually a preferred name
but I didnt research that just yet.

Understand these are bare metal examples that DO NOT use the mbed
development environment, these use gnu and or llvm toolchains.
See the stm32f0discovery top README for more on getting the tools.  The
way these mbed boards work is the debugger microcontroller emulates
a flash drive which we copy a file to when that .bin file arrives it
loads it into the evaluation microcontroller and starts it.  There is
no magic to the .bin files that know where or how they were created,
you can certainly try these examples on your board, and return to using
the mbed gui/sdk as well.

This is perhaps the board I have been waiting for for some time. The
key feature of this board is that the debugger portion basically
provides a virtual serial port for the host computer that is connected
to the uart on the eval microcontroller.  So basically we can use
a dumb terminal on the host (minicom, hyperterm, teraterm, putty, etc)
to develop and debug programs without buying any additional hardware.
Normally you would need to spend $10 to $15 on up for a usb to serial
and maybe some additional jumper wires.  (for the moment this virtual
com port does not work)

This chip uses a cortex-m0 core from ARM.  The cortex-m3 and cortex-m4
cores support the thumb instruction set and ARMv7-M thumb2 extensions
to the thumb instruction set.  The cortex-m0 (and m0+) only support the
ARMv6-M thumb2 extensions which is a much smaller set of additional
instrucitons compared to the ARMv7-M thumb2 extensions.  So folks that
are used to using the cortex-m3 for example may have problems on the
cortex-m0 where many of the thumb2 extensions are considered undefined
instructions (to get the extensions they took formerly undefined
instructions and defined them) and those programs wont run.  The
examples in this directory are built without thumb2 extensions so that
they will run on this cortex-m0.

I only bought this board because it is very closely related to the chip
used on my DWSTM32 directory examples.  Same internals just my little
breakout board has less pins.  The led on this board is on a pin that
the DWSTM32 board does not have.  So had to modify those.  The uart01
example does work if you hook up an external 3.3 level uart up but
it says that the solder bridges are in place by default, I see them
in place but /dev/ttyACM0 is not getting anything.  And i should have
done my research in that I dont think we can mess with boot0 so you
cant experience the serial bootloader like you can with a simple
breakout board.  This mbed thing makes it really easy that you just
copy the flash.bin file over.
