It really bugs me when I see the blinker example you are supposed to
run first be interrupt based.  Or any notion that interrupts is how
you do that.  While true you CAN use interrupts.  It should most
definitely not be the first or fifth or 20th thing you do.  Start with
polling, you can sometimes, often?, make your entire project without
using interrupts.  Just depends some on the problem and some on your
design.  Saying that, eventually you will want/need to know.  So this
is the first interrupt example.

Charlieplexing a two digit decimal number.

Tune these parameters to adjust if the background leds glow or not
and if so how much


    PUT32(STK_RVR,2000-1);

        if(bit&val) counter=5;
        //else counter=2; //others glow
        else counter=1; //others off


If you make the interrupt rate too high then you are bascally stuck
in the interrupt or worse, the counting and the uart output indicate
whether or not you have pushed it too far.
