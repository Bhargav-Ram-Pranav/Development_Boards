derived from spi01 and spi02

It uses the hardware spi master rather than bit banging.  spi01
is bit banged, spi02 was very useful for "seeing" what the spi
master was doing for various settings.

I have one of these

Can get them from china on ebay for much less, but can take a while
to get here.

This works out great as the hardware chip select (NSS) seems to only
work on the data size units.  This device is geared toward 8 bit things
so no problem there.  From spi02, I figured out that you could do
an 8 bit write to the data register if you wanted to send 8 bits if
you did a 16 bit you got two 8 bit transmissions.  I dont think the
STM32 doc mentions that, not in obvious places.

It of course has this extra D/C signal that is not part of spi.  so
we use another gpio pin and bit bang that.

As with spi01 the example doesnt do too much interesting but it does
demonstrate that we are talking to the device without having to bit
bang.  The Nokia datasheet says it supports up to 4MHz, this example
us using an internal 8MHz, not super accurate, so I wouldnt want to
gamble on 4MHz, but this sets it to divide by 4, 2Mhz and that works
fine.

You may also wish to control reset with yet another gpio pin.

I have more elaborate Nokia 5110 examples in other repos, writing various
things on the display.

These displays are quite cheap and quite useful, and there are a TON
of them out there.  I assume many are recycled from old phones, but
who knows, they appear to be new, not beat up so who knows why there
are so many.

This is taken from the DWSTM32 directory, this part has a faster
default clock, so needed a bigger divisor to keep the spi speed down.
Otherwise the same example.
