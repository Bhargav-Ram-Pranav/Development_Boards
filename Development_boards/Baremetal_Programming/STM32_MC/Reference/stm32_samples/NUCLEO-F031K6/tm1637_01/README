information.

Bought some TM1637 based seven segment displays.  The TM1637 is a
generic display controller, but there are displays with 4 digits
and a colon for sale at amazon and ebay and other usual places.

Four connections on the display GND, 5V, CLK, DIO so far it works with
3.3V for power and signals.

set bit 8 on second digit to light the colon.
0x06, 0x5D 0x4F, 0x66 colon off
0x06, 0xDD 0x4F, 0x66 colon on


0x40 by itself to say write data to display register
command 1 in datasheet.

0xC0 to set display address from beginning
command 2 in datasheet
data for first  segment
data for second segment
data for third  segment
data for fourth segment

dont have to do command 3 every time, just once up front is fine.

0x88 least bright 1/16th pulse width
0x8F most bright 14/16ths pulse width
