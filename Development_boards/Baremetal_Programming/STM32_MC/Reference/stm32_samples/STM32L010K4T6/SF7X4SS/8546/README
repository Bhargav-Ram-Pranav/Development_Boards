The attached kicad pcb file is what I used for this project.

SF7X4_8546.kicad_pcb
SF7X4_8546_MCU.kicad_pcb

Based around these seven segment displays from sparkfun.

Three boards total, the first one is just the leds and resistors.
The MCU board drives the leds, with numbers00 it takes a string
from the uart and displays four numbers based on that.  A third
board has a gps and extracts the time (very accurate and no
need to set the thing) and creates the string to send to the
mcu board.
