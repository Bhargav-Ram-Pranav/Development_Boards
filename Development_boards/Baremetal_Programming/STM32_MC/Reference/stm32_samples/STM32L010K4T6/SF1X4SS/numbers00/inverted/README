Well somebody who knows better and was thinking about it at the time
wanted to see what color each of the displays was so without using
a resistor powered across an led or two with 3.3v to ground.  First off
due to how the led behaved couldnt actually tell the color, second it
damaged the led.  Those good old 1/8th and 1/4th inch leds could handle
it.

fortunately (?) it was the d led on this module that I damaged.
since only b and c are used for the first digit since it is off or
a 1.

 //aaa
//f   b
//f   b
//f   b
 //ggg
//e   c
//e   c
//e   c
 //ddd

so the only real difference here is that I flipped all the numbers
swapped b and e, c and f, a and d.  and the order of the grounds.

was easier than I was expecting.

I had specifically designed both boards so that the usb connector is
on the bottom, for this one it will be on top...
