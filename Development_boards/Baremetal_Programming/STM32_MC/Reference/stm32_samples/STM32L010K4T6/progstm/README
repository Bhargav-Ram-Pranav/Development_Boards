In particular AN2606 and AN3155 were used to develop/verify this
program.

This is derived from my other progstm.  The low memory part here is
different than other stm32 parts.  It does not support the same commands
the same way, have to do page erases and cant write four bytes at a
time.  Experimentally figured out how to get it working.
