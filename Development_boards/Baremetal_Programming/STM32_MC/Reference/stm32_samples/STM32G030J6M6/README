This is the hookup to use the UART bootloader.  The documentation
is unclear.  It shows [PA9] and [PA10] but then in the pin
descriptions does not show these signals as having pins.  But this
happened to work.

This part does let you use the UART bootloader if the flash is empty
otherwise there is a security deal that blocks it, you are expected
to use SWD.  But if you use progstm (the one in this directory)
to program the part with the RUN_ME_FIRST binary.  it will change the
bit from default so that you can use boot0 and continue to use
the UART bootloader.  I assume this is the new norm, and/or the
bootloader will just go away some day.

After RUN_ME_FIRST remove power to the chip for it to work.

see the tiny.kicad_pcb board, costs like $1.50 for three at
oshpark.

I have an led on PB13

STM32G030J6M6
these cute little switches they dont look like the picture but they
fit/work just fine.

A 10K (0603) for the boot0 pull up, and then a 0603 led and resistor.
