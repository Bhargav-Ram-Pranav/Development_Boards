I dont have my microammeters yet, but this uses interrupts and wfi to
at least stop some of the arm not the systick timer clearly, but perhaps
this saves a little more power.  Will see.

I strongly suggest folks poll before using interrupts.  I didnt make a
polling example yet, but can/will that this would then be derived from
if you look at my other cortex-m examples I do that on almost every
board (and rarely use interrupts).

This uses the systick timer with interrupts and runs from flash (int02
uses sram and turns off the flash to save power).  The systick is in
the arm core and very intimate so you dont have to setup an NVIC or
anything, you enable interrupts on the peripheral and the core gets
interrupted when the counter rolls over/into zero.
