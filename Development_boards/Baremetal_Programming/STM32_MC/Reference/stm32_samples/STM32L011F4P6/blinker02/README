See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

Same as blinker01 except the main program is run in ram not flash
and the flash is turned off (have to pull boot0 to reprogram as
the flash is off if this boots right).  I think this saves 10 microamps.


(disconnect boot0 from ground)
reset
(into st serial bootloader)

halt
flash erase_sector 0 0 3
flash write_image blinker02/blinker02.elf

(connect boot0 to ground)
reset
