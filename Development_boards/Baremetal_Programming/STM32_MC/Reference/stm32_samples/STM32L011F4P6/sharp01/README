I like these sharp displays, very easy to program, very low power, want
to see how low.

display stm32
VIN     VCC
GND     GND
CS      PA0
MOSI    PA1
SCLK    PA2

leave the other signals on the display off.

       GND TX RX VCC (this row is on my breakout board)

looking down on the stm32l011 part

PF0                  SWDIO
PF1                  RX
NRST                 TX
VDDA                 VCC vin
