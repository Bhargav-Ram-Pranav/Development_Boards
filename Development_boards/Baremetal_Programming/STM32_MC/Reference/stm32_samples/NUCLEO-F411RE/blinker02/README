This expands on the blinker01 example by using a timer in the cortex-m.

This cortex-m4 has a system timer in the arm core itself, one that is
very simple to use.

This is actually two examples in one.  The first example blinks 5 times
watching one bit in the timer change, just to see that it works, the
second is more interesting.  There is an internal clock source HSI, we
assume the chip comes up using that clock.  The reference manual
says that this clock is 16MHz.  Assuming the systick timer runs off
of that clock without a divisor then if we count to 16 million then
that should be one second.  Count to 16 million N times that should
be N seconds.  The second loop, turns the led on for 10 seconds then
off for one.  Use a stop watch or watch or other reference to see
that this is the case.

The SysTick timer is documented in the cortex-m4 Technical Reference
Manual and/or the ARMv7-M Architectural Reference Manual available at
