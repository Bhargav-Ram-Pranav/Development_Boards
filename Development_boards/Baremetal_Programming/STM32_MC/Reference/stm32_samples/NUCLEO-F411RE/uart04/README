information.

Derived from uart02.  This takes what it receives from rx and sends
echos it out tx.

So this is the baseline for projects.  The chip comes up using HSI
at 16Mhz, the HSE is 8MHz, this example uses the PLL to multiply that
to 16MHz.  If you have the HSE of 8Mhz then use this example if not
then you can use uart03 which uses the HSI.  or use this one and
comment out the clock init.
