Simlar to blinker02 except this uses a very simple timer in the chip
but outside the arm core.  One of the on chip peripherals.

This is a 32 bit timer.  Using it a little differently than the SysTick
timer in blinker02.  In this case the timer is set to roll over at
16,000,000.  Assuming it is running off of the 16MHz internal clock
with no scaling then the timer should roll over every second.  Each
time it rolls over (it counts down so roll over is down to 0 then
reloading 16 million) the interrupt fires, the interrupt is disabled
but the status register flag is set, so we can poll that bit to wait
one second.
