I made a little charlieplexed board with 12 leds, 4 I/O pins.

Like charlie03, but more of the data is pre-computed.  So there is
less code from a lines of code sense.  But more tables, the binaries
are actually a little bit bigger than the charlie03 approach.  With
less executed code it should be quicker getting from one led blinking
to the next so they should be on a little longer.

Just another way to do it.

This is trivial for me to convert to hex

//....
//00..
//0...
0x0C8,

but maybe not for everyone, so one could also have written a program
to parse hand made strings of characters representing on and off, and
created the hex from that.
