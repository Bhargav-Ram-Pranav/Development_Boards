See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

Derived from blinker02, using whatever clock it comes up with.

Tried to use a timer6 example from another stm32, but this chip doesnt
have a timer6 even though the reference manual documents, it note
at the top of the section the list of parts the timer6/7 section covers.
Not this one,  there is a general purpose timer14 and it programs the
same basically as timer6, and worked great.

As written here changes state every 8 seconds give or take

65536000 / 8 = 8192000
65536000 / 8000000 = 8.192

The datasheet indicates the internal timer is used to boot, naturally,
and that is an 8Mhz oscillator, so both this and the prior examples
demonstrate this.  Both also demonstrate that without messing with
things these timers/clocks are not divided/prescaled from the 8MHz.
