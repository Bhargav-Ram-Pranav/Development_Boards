This uses spi to talk to a pair of Nordic nRF24L01+ modules.  One
setup for RX the other for TX.

Sparkfun has one

But the ones I am using are from China bought on ebay.  Cost less than
a buck each, with about $2 for shipping you might as well buy a 5 or
10 pack and still pay $2 for shipping.  I think I paid $10 for 10 all
said and done.

Now I tried all kinds of settings and they were unreliable as hell.
Only some of the transfers would go through.  I reduced it to only
disable auto ack (ShockBurst) and leave the rest defaulted, and I
think everything is going through now.

I dont know what the range is on these, but pretty damn simple to
use.  Pretty damn cheap to buy.

bit banging the spi for now, using the same pins used by the hardware
spi so I can switch back and forth when I get around to using the
spi peripheral.

I do have one of the sparkfun boards linked above and one
of these

And I can mess with some registers that I cant mess with with the
china modules, and it works great, or to say it another way, if
I use the settings in the fob page examples the sparkfun board works
great for receiving fob data, but the other boards do not.  I assume
it may have to do with the antenna.
