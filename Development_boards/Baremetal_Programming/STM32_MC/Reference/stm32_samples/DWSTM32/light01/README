On par with the blinkers, a quick and dirty to measure pulses from a
light sensor

https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9768

I am using GND and VCC from VSS and VDD, and using PA0 as the input.

It measures the pulse using the ARMs systick timer, lower is more
light below a threshold it turns on the leds (PA4 and PA5), above that
it turns them off.  It also outputs the measurement on the uart.
