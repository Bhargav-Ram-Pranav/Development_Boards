See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

So far I have thorougly enjoyed using this little board I made.

Press and hold boot0
press and release reset
release boot0
run progstm
press and release reset

But moving into using the uart then it is

exit minicom
Press and hold boot0
press and release reset
release boot0
run progstm
run minicom
press and release reset

With this bootloader you can then stay in miniloader

press and release reset
download hex file to bootloader
press g to go

It is sram based programs not flash, but can still do a lot of things
with the simpler number of steps.  Then later use progstm to try the
flash version if desired.

This bootloader accepts intel hex formatted files, so you do an ascii
or raw download of an intel hex version of the program.  Going to go
back through and add this to these examples.  the sram.hex file in the
examples basically.

I have xmodem flavor bootloaders as well but not necessarily planning
to make one for this platform.
