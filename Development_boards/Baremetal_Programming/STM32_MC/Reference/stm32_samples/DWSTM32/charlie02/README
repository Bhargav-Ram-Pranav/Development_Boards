information.

I made a little charlieplexed board with 12 leds, 4 I/O pins.

The prior ones just lit one led at a time which still requires
understanding how charlieplexing works.  But the one led was on for
the duration of the time period.  If you want more than one led "on"
at a time.  You need to blink each of them briefly over and over
again, fast enough that the eye cannot detect it, but slow enough
that they get enough light out.  If you blink them as fast as you
can then you get more of a glow than them looking fully on.  They
are still not as intense as being fully on for the duration.
