documentation for this board.

In particular AN2606 and AN3155 were used to develop/verify this
program.  See the erase example for more information on starting
to talk to the bootloader.

This example takes the blinker01 program, flash version, and programs
it into the flash on the part.  You have to hold boot0 then press
and release reset, then release boot0 to boot the part using the
internal bootloader.  Once you run this loader then press and
release reset (without boot0) to run it, the leds should blink.  To
erase use the erase program or modify this one, using the boot0 button
with reset.

This is not a generic program with command line options, but instead
a library of tools if you will with an example test program.
