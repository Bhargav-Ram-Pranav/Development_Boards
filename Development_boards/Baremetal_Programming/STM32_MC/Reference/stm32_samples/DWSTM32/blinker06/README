This uses TIM14.  At least on my board PA4 is one of the leds, and
that also is one of the output pins for TIM14.  Alternate function 4.

So we have to set the PA4 to AF4, and to use the timer output you have
to use capture/compare 1.  And enable CC1 to output.

Multiple examples in this one example, the first one forces the output
high or low.  The rest toggle the output.

CC1 is independent-ish of the timer.  We setup the timer like before
in this case to auto-reload when it rolls over.  We pick some value,
in this case just left 0x0000 in the compare register.  When that
matches the timer we have it configured to toggle the output.

The last setup shows that we have set a compare value that the timer
never reaches and as a result we dont toggle.  So you have to manage
both parts, the timer and how it runs, and the compare value.
