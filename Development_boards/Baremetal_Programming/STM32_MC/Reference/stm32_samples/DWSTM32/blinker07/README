Derived from blinker06

TIM14 has a PWM mode that is pretty easy to use.  The timer itself
has a reload register for when it rolls over, independent of that
there is a compare register.  The PWM operates such that in one
mode if the timer count is less than the compare register the output
is on, otherwise off.  (the other mode is vice vers on if greater than).

So the timer is used to set your period, and the compare register to
determine the duty cycle.

I have the timer fast enough to not see it blink, but not so fast
that it overwhelms the led.  Using another, independent, timer I
change the compare value adjusting the duty cycle over time making
the led glow brighter and dimmer.

not changing the compare register of course the hardware drives the
output at that duty cycle and frequency without any software involved
other than setup.
