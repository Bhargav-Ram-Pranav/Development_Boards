This also uses the PLL to bump the frequency to 48MHz.  This example
uses the TIM2 timer, which is a 32 bit timer.
48000000 = 0x02DC6C00
So we can easily count each of those clocks without rolling over the
clock for a while.  89 seconds before it rolls over.

Three examples in one.  First one just checks one bit to see that it is
working.  The second subtracts the difference between prior and current
to see how many have elapsed.  And then third a more realistic example
that you set the rollover value to the time you want, and checking
status.
