There is a board called the blue pill or stm32 blue pill using
an STM32F103C8T6.  And then some folks starting making them using
black pcbs instead of blue, calling them black pills.  And then an
stm32f4 discovery clones made with black pcbs and now this new
stm32 black pill based on the STM32F401CCU6

This is about the latter STM32F401CCU6 based black pill.

Google STM32F4 black pill, they are a few bucks from asia.  Mine
was $9 on Amazon.  Has a usb-c connector and comes with pins, some
soldering required if you want to use them.  Can do lots of good
learning without those pins though.

If you press and hold BOOT0 while you press and release NRST (then
release boot0)

Then

dfu-util -l

(may need to apt-get install dfu-util)

Then press and release NRST by itself to run the program.

You will need the datasheet from st, go to st.com and search for
STM32F401CCU6
follow the hit, get the datasheet.

Then somewhere on the device
page you can find reference manuals, currently RM0368 goes with
this device, get that.

These tell you that the device uses a cortex-m4 core from ARM, so
go to infocenter.arm.com and get the cortex-m4 technical reference
manual.

Which tells you it is based on the armv7-m architecture so
also get the armv7-m architectural reference manual.

This is your basic minimum documentation set for working on this device.
A schematic would be nice too, will see about that, the pins appear
to have their gpio numbers on them A2, A3...B2, B3 etc...So that will
do for now.

RM0368 is also used for the STM32F401RE which they have a nucleo board
for, so its the same family/core.  From the datasheets
F401RE  64 pin package 512Kbytes of flash
F401CCU6 48/48 pin, 256Kbytes of flash, UFQFPN package.

Basically both are the STM32F401.
