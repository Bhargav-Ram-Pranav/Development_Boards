See the top level README for documentation and schematics for this board.

These $2 china boards have a 32.768Hz oscillator for the RTC.  So
why not try.  The appnote AN2821 leaves some steps out.  Have to read
the reference manual to fill in the gaps.  Will make a clock from this
and see how it drifts.  Ideally want to take this and a PPS from a
GPS and see how it drifts relative to that.   Also compare it to HSE
as calibration steps mention HSE.  Is HSE more accurate?  I should
try an RTC with HSE.  I dont have specs on this boards components, so
dont know their advertised accuracy.

Yes, could do lots of division/modulo but that takes a lot of clock
cycles, so this BCD thing is I assume on par or better.  Should
actually do it BCD and not separate variables, is that faster or slower?
(as it could be all register based through the math if BCD from
one 32 bit variable, but separate variables its gotta swap out to stack).
Hmm, actually gcc 6.2 burned a bunch of registers.
