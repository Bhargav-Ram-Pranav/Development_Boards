See the top level README for documentation and schematics for this board.

EXTI example detects an edge on an input pin PB8 in this case and
that causes an interrupt.  To avoid bounce and to control the edges
I tied PB8 to PB9 and by changing pb9 I can control the pb8 input.
The final version toggles pb9 every second, so the one edge being detected
causes an interrupt every two seconds.
