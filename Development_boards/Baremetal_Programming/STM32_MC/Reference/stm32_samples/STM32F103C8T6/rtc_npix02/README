information.

Adafruit calls these things neopixels.  Worldsemi calls them Intelligent
control LED integrated light source.  The part number is WS2812B.

Very interesting creatures...See other npix examples for a description
of how this code interfaces these leds.

Will see with time, my other approach didnt seem to work, not sure why.
Now going with the just divide out the RTC counter into HH:MM.  Derived
from rtc04 where the 32768hz clock is used.  The rtc timer counts in
units of half a second, so 120 ticks per minute.  Long division is used
(soft divide cant be much different, but probably tighter code) to
extract the hours and minutes.
