derived from blinker01, using whatever clock it comes up with.

The cortex-m3 has a systick timer built in.  This example is counting
to 50Million clocks then toggling the led.  It changes state every 6
seconds give or take.  Basically it appears this is an 8Mhz clock.
50000000/80000000 = 6.25 seconds.

The documentation talks about an HSI clock that is 8MHz, so there
you go.
