Bought an LCD on ebay for like $5

Portions of the description

Arduino kit 5bit 7Seg LCD LED SPI Digital tube with UNO MEGA2560 Pro C program
Module No.:  TB233
5 Digit 7 Seg SPI LCD Display Module
HT1621



Searching for this gave the best result.

5 Digit 7 Seg SPI LCD Display Module

It has a green backlight (can be disabled) 5 digits and two arrows
pointing left.

Uses an HT1621B controller, which is not quite spi but close enough
chip select, clock and data.  (Technically the controller has two
clocks a write clock and a read clock they dont expose the read clock
so it does basically feel like a spi with out the MISO signal).

To disable the led, there is an led signal you can see on the
back there is a signal headed to the backlight that has two
solder bridges, one is connected the unconnected one on mine went to
the led pin.  Unsolder the one solder bridge and then you have no
backlike to deal with, solder the other short and you can use the pin.
Or if you dont mind the backlight, just leave it on.  Didnt look to
see if there was a control/command from the HT1621, I dont think
there is I think it just comes on when the board is powered.
