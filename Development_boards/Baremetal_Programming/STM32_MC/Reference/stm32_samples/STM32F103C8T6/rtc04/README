Still trying to sort out why my time was so wrong.  Going with the
just divide the timer approach.  The prescaler is 36 bits,
cant count a whole minute with the 32768 timer, but can count half a
minute so the timer ticks every 30 seconds.  So it takes 120 ticks to
make a minute.  1440 ticks per half day.  So take the count, compute
modulo 1440, then divide by 120 result is hours, remainder is minutes
times 2.

Only using the lower timer register, around 1.5 million days before I
run into a rollover situation and the time goes wrong.  Aver 4000 years
dont think this is a problem.
