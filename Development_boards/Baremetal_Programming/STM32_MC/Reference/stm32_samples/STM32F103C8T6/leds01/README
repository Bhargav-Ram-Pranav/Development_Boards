Simple led matrix board I made.  A0-A3 are the columns, the positive
side of the leds A0 is tied to the positive side of 3 leds in one
column.  A4-A6 are the rows, each tied to the negatives of all the leds
in that row.  Resistors on each row and column.  So if you want one
led on then you want the column high and the row low for that one
led the others you dont want on then either column low or row high or
both.  So kinda charlieplexing, but not, uses more pins than a nice
charlieplexd array would (normally only 4 pins for 12 leds).  This
was constructed by hand on perf board, so went this route.

Multiple examples in one, blink rate on some have to do with how
many bits are on or not, not interested in even blinking for all
combinations, just demonstrating all combinations.
