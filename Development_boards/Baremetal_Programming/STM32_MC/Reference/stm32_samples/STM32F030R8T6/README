So I bought some seven segment lcd panels on ebay.  Turns out the
price was on par with mouser, of course shipping was significantly
better.

It didnt say but I think they are or are similar enough to
the lumex LCD-A401C71TR

Then I got a 64 pin microcontroller, since you need a ton of pins,
each segment is a separate pin.  Some displays have 8 pins for the seven
segment (seven plus a decimal point is eight), and then a common
for each digit, so in this case you would have eight plus four.  But for
those you have to blink each digit.  This one each segement is separate
you dont need to blink anything just leave them on.  I have read some
web pages that talked about feeding these a sine wave of some frequency.
Hmmm, the lumex document above says operating voltage 5V AC.  Well
so far it works, just driving them 3.3V DC.  Will see if something
wears out or dies...Okay I stand corrected.  The lcd panel doesnt like
this.  If you leave some segments on even for a minute or minutes it
starts to look strange getting lighter in an uneven way.  Then if you
turn on others briefly they are darker and even.  So far it has
recovered from this but it takes hours I think, certainly not minutes.
Trying to blink them digitally did not get them "on" so maybe you really
do need a 5V sine wave.

bigled.brd is an eagle file for the board I built for this, had it
made at oshpark.  I dont remember the size not but for the small one
inch by one inch boards or so oshpark is more reasonable than the
china board shops, but this one may be near or at the edge where it
starts to get too expensive for oshpark.  I have not yet used anything
other than oshpark, my boards have all been really small..

blinker01 just to see if the board works and some segments
blinker02 was a lot of experiments trying to figure out the pins, I
could have figured it out from my board design, but this was pretty
quick.  seven.c was used to build the on/off bits for each segment,
the values to write into the BSRR registers.

And gps_clock02 is the purpose of this board, this chip, etc.
