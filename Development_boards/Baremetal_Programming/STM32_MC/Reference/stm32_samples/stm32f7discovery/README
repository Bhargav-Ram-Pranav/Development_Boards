You will want the users manual for the board  then search on the part

STM32F746NGH6

And get the data sheet and the reference manual for the part.

The board users manual shows an led on PI1, through solder bridge 8.
Solder bridge 8 came shorted on my board.  And the led works (start with
blinker01).  This led is on the bottom next to the reset (black) button.

Being MBED like/based, you simply copy the flash.bin file you create
over to the virtual flash drive that pops up when you plug this into
the board.

The mini-b connector is the power, the micro-bs are OTG
