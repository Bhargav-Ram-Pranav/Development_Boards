Someone on stackoverflow was having a problem with the DWT cycle counter
not working.  The Cortex-M7 TRM had an error, which kinda stands out
when you step back a few feet.  The list of registers all start with
0xE0001xxx except the LAR and LSR.  Lock access and lock status.  For
the cortex-m7 at least the one I have and the one the OP has the
DWT lock is present and locked.  So you need to unlock it in order to
set the cycle count enable bit in order to see the cycle counts.

I imagine it is just bulk capacitance or sometihng, but found this
interesting.  The reset button does not reset this stuff, if you
run this program once, and then reset.  It is all enabled so from the
beginning you can see the timer runing.  I commented out the
unlock write to 0xE0001FB0, programmed that into flash.  Then pulled
the power for a while, then powered back up.  Then uncommented the line
and wrote it to flash, then you get the desired output that had us
stumped for a while until someone pointed out the documentation error

00000000

If you use 0xE0000FB0 as documented, it doesnt unlock the timer.
