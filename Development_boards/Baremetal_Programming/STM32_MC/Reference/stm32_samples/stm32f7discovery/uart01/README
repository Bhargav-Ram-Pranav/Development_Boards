blinker02 showed us that we are at 16MHz.  16000000/115200 = 138.8 or
139

With this board they have a virtual serial port using the same mini
b usb as the one we power with so on linux it is /dev/ttyACM0.

Unline other stm32 cards which normally use PA9 and PA10.  This one
appears to be using PA9 for USART1_TX but PB7 for USART1_RX which this
example does not use, but a future one will.

This example sets up PA9 for alternate function 7 (USART1_TX) and
sets up the uart and blasts 0123456701234567 forever.  At 115200 8N1.
