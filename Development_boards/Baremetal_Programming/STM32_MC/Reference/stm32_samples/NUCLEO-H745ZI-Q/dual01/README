This is one way to skin this cat.

The cortex-m4 boots from 0x08100000 the cortex-m7 from the traditional
STM32 0x08000000.  What you do with this is use a modern enough openocd
with dual bank enabled and

flash write_image erase notmain4.elf

The code here will change the VTOR to 0x08000000 and then branch to the
cortex-m7 reset handler read from 0x08000004.

Now the cortex-m7 code has to handle two processors running the same
code.  I dont yet know what that does to the performance, maybe ART
takes care of it.
