The cortex-m7 cpuid is not as documented.

0x411FC271   cortex-m7 cpuid
0x410FC241   cortex-m4 cpuid

User LD1: a green user LED is connected to the STM32H7 I/O PB0 (or PA5)
User LD2: a yellow user LED is connected to PE1
User LD3: a red user LED is connected to PB14

the cortex-m7 boots at 0x08000000 or bank0
the cortex-m4 boots at 0x08100000 or bank1

by default.  there are multiple srams so easy to isolate their stacks
and such.
