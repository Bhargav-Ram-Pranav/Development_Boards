See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

so starting to mess with the e-paper display, which is really why
I bought this board

PA8     BUSY
PB2     RESET
PB11    D/C
PA15    CS
PB3     SCK
PB5     MOSI
PB10    PWR_EN

Now I have not figured out if PWR_EN is really doing anything.

I had to google GDE021A1 to find the documentation, a search at the
site didnt work (the site that they point you to that makes the
displays).

Bit banging the spi for now another thing to figure out if I bother
to.
