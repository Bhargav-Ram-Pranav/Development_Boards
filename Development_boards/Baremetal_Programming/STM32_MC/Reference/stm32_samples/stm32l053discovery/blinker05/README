Same as blinker04 but is using timer6.  the delay internals waits
for the msbit of the timer to change state twice, so basically 65536
counts the way we are using it here.  repeat that 1000 times or
65536000.  divided by 8000000 is 8.192 seconds, but the led is
changing more like 16 or 17 seconds 16.384 perhaps.  Post-reset the
peripheral clocks should not be divided so, here again I think the
HSE, external input clock which is an output from the stlink, is
possibly 4MHz not 8MHz as they have documented, trying to find a
divide by 2 somewhere.
