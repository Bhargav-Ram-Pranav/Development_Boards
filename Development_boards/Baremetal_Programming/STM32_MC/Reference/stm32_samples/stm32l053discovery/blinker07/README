This demonstrates using the pll to run at 32MHz.  First switching
to HSI16 then sets PLL to (HSI16*6)/3 = 96/3.  One thing you have to
pay attention to is that the flash on the mcus cant always run at these
relatively faster speeds, so you need wait states.  This specific part
has only one bit for wait states, basically two speeds.  Some may have
a number of speeds, and what you need to think about is that if your
program runs from the flash, but the flash is divided down some
number of wait states.  If you run at zero wait states at speed N,
the processor can fetch at one speed.  If you double the clock but
half the flash speed the flash is still the same speed, so although
it can execute faster, it cannot fetch any faster so the instruction
rate into the processor has not increased.  If you have more speed
choices (not this part or family but some parts or brands) so maybe
the flash is running twice as fast and the clock four times as fast
that would be a win.
