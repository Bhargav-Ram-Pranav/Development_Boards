Derived from uart02 and epd02

PA10 is USART1_RX alternate function 4

This is a very simple gps based clock, in theory highly accurate.

Uses the epaper display, need to work on the font to make it bigger/
better.

I am not bothering to check the checksum, nor if it is even locked,
quick and dirty.

change this for your timezone.  or daylight savings

                        ra=5; //time zone adjustment

Not attempting to be low power.  Supposedly the blink on screen refresh
is the nature of the beast, it has been hostorically for these displays
because they are mechanical and that wiping in theory prevents pixels
from sticking.  but as you may know from a modern kindle or other they
now will go for some to several refreshes before they do a wipe.  So
printing seconds on this display would not make sense.

TODO better font of course, add the date, maybe a thermal sensor and
the temp.
