Same as blinker03 but is using the systick timer built into the
cortex-m0+.  Counting to 40Million should give 5 seconds at 8MHz
but is giving 10 seconds.  So there is a divide by 2 in there
somewhere.  It could be that the clock from the stlink MCO is not
really 8MHz but instead 4.  Further debug is required here.
