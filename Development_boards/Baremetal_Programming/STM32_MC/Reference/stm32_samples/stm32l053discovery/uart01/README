PA9 is USART1_TX alternate function 4
PA10 is USART1_RX alternate function 4

This example switches to internal HSI16 16MHz clock.  Enables port A
configures PA9 as the UART1_TX output.

The uart is setup for 115200 baud, 16000000Hz/115200 = 138.88

This example blasts the characters 0123456701234567... forever as
fast as it can.  If using minicom you need to alt-a then w to switch
to wraparound mode so you can see them.

Unfortunately the board as-is does not have a nice way to get at the
uart. they have two solder bridges SB2 and SB3, that are easy to solder
bridge across, and that will connect PA9/PA10 to RX/TX.  Or you can
put pins in the RX TX holes, or otherwise somehow connect PA9
to the RX and PA10 to the TX.  Then you can use the /dev/ttyACM0 serial
interface to see what is going on.
