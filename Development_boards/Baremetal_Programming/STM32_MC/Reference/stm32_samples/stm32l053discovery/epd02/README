See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

so starting to mess with the e-paper display, which is really why
I bought this board

PA8     BUSY
PB2     RESET
PB11    D/C
PA15    CS
PB3     SCK
PB5     MOSI
PB10    PWR_EN

I still have not figured out if PWR_EN is really doing anything.

Still bit banging the spi.

But I have the data format figured out, you can basically flip the
x or y or both giving 4 setups.  Picked the one I liked, my font file
was pretty much set for that already.  So this draws the beginning
of the alphabet in three sizes.
