See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

This demonstrates using both usart1 and usart2.  Whatever is received
in one is transmitted out the other.  Carriage returns are cooked.
if you dont have something to hook PA9/PA10 to then you can take a
paperclip or something and connect D2 to D8 on the arduino connectors
or the corresponding male pins (see the users manual for the nucleo
boards to find PA9 and PA10 for this board).  If you do that loopback
and the virtual port on usart2 then what is typed on your host goes
into usart2 tx, goes out usart1 tx, comes back in usart1 rx, goes out
usart2 tx.  In this configuration each carriage return gets cooked
twice so you get double spaced output on your terminal.
