See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

So this is the start of a clock that uses the DS3231 Extremely Accurate
RTC.  This is not part of this board but an add on.  Can find boards
with batteries under $5 on ebay.  A couple of jumper (male to male or
male to female) at sparkfun or adafruit for not too much.

Going to see how accurate it really is or at least compare it to
an atomic clock or gps.  Eventually.

For now just the basics of bit banged i2c.  Also want to try to use
the i2c peripheral in the st chip, let the hardware do some of the
work, eventually.

For now the time is sent serially out usart2 which is connected to
the stlink virtual serial port (see uart01 example).
