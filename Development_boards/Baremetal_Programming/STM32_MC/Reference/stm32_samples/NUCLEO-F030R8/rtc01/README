Well this was an interesting exercise.  There are chicken and egg
problems in the document, after enabling the power block and the write
protect bit that is in there.  Then you are supposed to have to unlock
the rtc writes with an rtc register, but the rtc is not enabled so
how do you talk to the rtc unlock register to unlock the bit you need
to power the rtc to talk to the rtc unlock register to power the rtc
to talk to the rtc unlock register to power the rtc...

I got something to work.
