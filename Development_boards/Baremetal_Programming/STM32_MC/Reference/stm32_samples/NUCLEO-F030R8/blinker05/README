Same as blinker03 except it switches to the external clock first.

The documentation tells us that the HSE external clock comes from an
MC0 output of the stlink controller.  This example demonstrates switching
from the HSI internal 8MHz clock to the external HSE 8MHz clock.

As described in blinker04 a safety measure is in place.  If this
bricks the microcontroller, then press and hold the user button, then
press the reset button, when it comes out of reset it will see the
user button pressed and not enter the code that messes with clocks
(and is likely what bricked the board).  This is mostly for me since
if you are reading this then this code works and does not brick the
board, and here if you change this code to protect you.
