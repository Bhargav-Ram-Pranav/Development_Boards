So no leds on a breakout board.  I have some of the wee bitty led boards
used by the lillypad folks for wearable whatever.  added two pins so
I have a nice little led and resistor.  you can fashion the same thing
on a breadboard or whatever. if brave can tie the led directly from
pin to ground, but that does stress the part (not on this part but
I have been doing that kind of thing for years, again bad, but I have
gotten lucky).

for sanity I hook the led up between power (3.3) and ground to see
it come on then move the 3.3 jumper to the gpio pin of interest, if you
have the led backwards you can spend all day going crazy not getting it
to turn on.

The stm32f0discovery board has a similar part to this so I modified
the blinker01 example to use PA1 instead of the leds that the
stm32f0discovery board uses.

in the telnet window

> reset halt
> load_image blinker01/blinker01.gcc.sram.elf
> resume 0x20000000

dont mess with the flash version yet just the sram one, we have to
figure out how to program the flash first.
