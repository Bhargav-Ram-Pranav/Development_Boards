This subdirectory contains examples that are not limited to but developed
on the pcb saved here

stm32fun.kicad_pcb
stm32fun2.kicad_pcb

stm32fun is powered and controlled by discrete wires, access to use
the bootloader uart mode as well as SWD to program the MCU.

stm32fun2 is meant to be used with a 3.3V Arduino like 6 pin board
like these

but can be used with individual signals.  Only the bootloader uart
pins are exposed not SWD.

The progstm directory contains a tool that I use to program the flash
in these devices.
