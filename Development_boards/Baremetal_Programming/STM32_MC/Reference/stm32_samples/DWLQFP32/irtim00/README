I probably tried this elsewhere.  You shouldnt use JTAG/SWD for this
one as PA13 is used.

Ideally I need a part with PB9 and the high drain, but PA13 also
has IR_OUT.

This is my first experiment with the IRTIM timer.  It ands TIM16 and
TIM17 outputs so you can use one of them as a carrier and the other
as data for infrared, think TV remote control stuff.  Normally the
carrier is near 40KHz, but this one was done slower so we could visually
see it working.


    PUT16(TIM17_PSC,0x10-1); 
    PUT16(TIM17_ARR,0x7A12);
    PUT16(TIM17_CCR1,0x7A12);

The carrier is at 0x7A120 or 500,000 ticks
8000000/500000 = 16
16 blinks a second.
It is likely 0x7A130 as it counts from 0x0000 to 0x7A12 but not sure
will have to put it on a scope.

    PUT16(TIM16_PSC,0x1000-1);
    PUT16(TIM16_ARR,0x2000);
    
0x2000000 / 8000000 = 4.19 seconds.

So compared to ground IR_OUT blinks at 16 times a second for 4.19 seconds
then it goes solid high, for 4.19 seconds, then blinks then solid, etc.

The next step is to get the carrier closer to 40Khz put an ir led on
it, set up an ir receiver and see what we see.  Check on a scope, then
after that use an ir protocol to transmit something.

I dont know what the blank they were doing with the example in the
reference manual.  The carrier was not an even rate.  And the envelope
side was not enabled.
