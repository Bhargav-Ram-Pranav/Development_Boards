Need to use SWD to program this board, if you search for

SWD JLINK

on ebay, its a purple board with a mini-b usb on one end and four
pins sticking out the other under the pins labelled

TVCC
GND
SWDCLK
SWDIO

Currently a little over $5

Plus some jumper wires, female to female. Search for

jumper wire f/f

Under $2 currently for 40 of them.

The SWD board does not power the mcu board TVCC is a monitor,

SWD  MCU board

TVCC    VCC
GND     GND
SWDCLK  CLK
SWDIO   DIO

I make no claim to be an expert at pcb design, I cheated and took
shortcuts.  A real design should have more R's and C's at a minimum,
and then go from there.  But these function well enough for me.

Simple seven segment display board, common cathode.

Looking at the display, 8 pins on the left

0 PA7
1 PA6
2 PA5
3 PA4
4 PA3
5 PA2
6 PA1
7 PA0

right side is the grounds from the top

0 PB4
1 PB5
2 PB6
3 PB7

Specifically I used these parts

HDSP-513G (green)
HDSP-513E (red)

I used 750Ohm resistors, I didnt want this too bright, built one with
130ohm to be a little brighter for a lit room.

MCU board.

The mcu from this directory tree
STM32F030K6T6

MTK3339 PA6H gps receiver.  I think it is called the ladybird 1 I usually
only need to search for PA6H GPS.  9600 baud.

Voltage regulator
AP2112K-3.3TRG1
and the caps its datasheet calls out, I think 1.0uf

Wurth 61400413321 usb connector.
USB B is way overkill, but...they are easy to hand solder and cheap (enough).

Dont need the reset pull up resistor.  The boot0 pull down 4.7K or 10K
or whatever your preference is.

Standard sized header pins.  0.254mm which is 0.1 inch pitch?  If you
dont want to hard solder these together, then get a male and female
set I soldered mine to each other with enough spacing to not short out
and to be able to build an enclosure and mount.

I have my boards built at oshpark.  YMMV
