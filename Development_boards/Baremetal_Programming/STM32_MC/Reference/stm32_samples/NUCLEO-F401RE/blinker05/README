The internal clock (HSI) for this part is 16MHz, that is what we have
been using so far in the blinker examples.  This example starts by
blinking the led using a 4 million timer tick delay so 1/4th of a second
on and 1/4th of a second off.

The stlink end of the board outputs an 8MHz clock which to us is the
external HSE clock input.  The example switches to this HSE input with
no multiplication (PLL) and no division, so we should basically slow
down to half speed, then it blinks the led some more, at half speed
that means the blinking should be half the rate, 1/2 second on, 1/2
second off.

As described in blinker04 a safety measure is in place.  If this
bricks the microcontroller, then press and hold the user button, then
press the reset button, when it comes out of reset it will see the
user button pressed and not enter the code that messes with clocks
(and is likely what bricked the board).  This is mostly for me since
if you are reading this then this code works and does not brick the
board, and here if you change this code to protect you.
