This directory contains examples for the stm32f0 nucleo board
specifically the stm32 NUCLEO-F401RE.

Starting page for all of the nucleo boards

http://www.st.com/stm32nucleo

Then navigate to the NUCLEO-F401RE page by clicking on that name in
the graph.

As of this writing you will need the UM1724: STM32 Nucleo Boards users
manual.

As of this writing there is no direct link to the microcontroller page
so do a search on the st website for STM32F401RE

Under Part Number Results there is one hit and select that link
to get to the part page.

Click on the Design Resources tab.

We need the Reference Manual
RM0368: STM32F401xB/C and STM32F401xD/E advanced ARMÂ®-based 32-bit MCUs

Unlike older/original mbed boards, it does not appear that you have
to press the reset button after copying the .bin file to run the
new program.  But, at least for me it sometimes takes a while before
the newly copied program is loaded and started in the microcontroller.

You can certainly press reset as much as you like after it is loaded
to try the new program again and again.

In the old (mbed) days the .bin file would stay there, my experience
today is that the .bin file goes away.  Historically I would choose a
specific file name (flash.bin for example) and copy to that filename on
the mbed (nucleo) device.  I think there is actually a preferred name
but I didnt research that just yet.

Understand these are bare metal examples that DO NOT use the mbed
development environment, these use gnu and or llvm toolchains.
See the stm32f0discovery top README for more on getting the tools.  The
way these mbed boards work is the debugger microcontroller emulates
a flash drive which we copy a file to when that .bin file arrives it
loads it into the evaluation microcontroller and starts it.  There is
no magic to the .bin files that know where or how they were created,
you can certainly try these examples on your board, and return to using
the mbed gui/sdk as well.

This chip uses a cortex-m4 core from ARM.  The cortex-m3 and cortex-m4
cores support the thumb instruction set and ARMv7-M thumb2 extensions
to the thumb instruction set.  The cortex-m0 (and m0+) only support the
ARMv6-M thumb2 extensions which is a much smaller set of additional
instrucitons compared to the ARMv7-M thumb2 extensions.  The examples
in this directory compile for thumb and thumb+thumb2 in separate
binaries.


Start with the blinker examples then move on to ...

blinker01 turns led on and off, burns cpu cycles to delay
blinker02 turns led on and off, cortex-m systick
blinker03 turns led on and off, tim5 timer
blinker04 turns led on and off based on user button
blinker05 turns led on and off, tim5 timer uses HSE clock instead of internal
blinker06 turns led on and off, uses the rtc to count seconds
blinker07 turns led on and off, uses systick interrupt

uart01 sends 01234567 in a loop.
