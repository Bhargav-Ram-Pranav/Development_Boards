This was fun and interesting.  If you enable interrupts but set
SEVONPEND, wfe will continue after the interrupt, but the ISR wont
get called.  But that alone is not enough the first wfe returns the
second doesnt.  The interrupt is clear from the peripheral.  But still
pending.  The ICSR register was the key for systick.  Chip vendor
interrupts are perhaps stuck elsewhere.
