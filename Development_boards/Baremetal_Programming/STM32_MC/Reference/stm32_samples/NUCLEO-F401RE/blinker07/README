This example uses the cortex-m systick timer, but uses interrupts, when
the timer reaches zero you get an interrupt.  The ISR then blinks the
led.

The systick timer is part of the ARM core, we use the word interrupt
and it is, but we didnt have to program the nvic nor did we have to
enable interrupts to the core.  It just worked.  For interrupts that
come in from outside the core (external (to the core) interrupts) those
require additional work.
