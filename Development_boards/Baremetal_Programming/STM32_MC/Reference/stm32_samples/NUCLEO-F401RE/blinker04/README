See the top level README for schematic and programmers reference information.

It is a good practice that before messing with clock sources we have
a way to back out.  I dont know if this part is brickable.  So
this example lights the led when the user button is pressed, later we
will use the button to change the path of the program to not allow it
to touch the clocks, and allow us to recover from a bug that might
otherwise brick the board.

The board manual says

B1 USER: the user button is connected to the I/O PC13 (pin 2) of the STM32
microcontroller.
B2 RESET: this push button is connected to NRST, and is used to RESET
the STM32 microcontroller.

So we need to monitor PC13.

It appears that PC13 is pulled high so when not pressed we get a 1
and pressed we get a 0.
