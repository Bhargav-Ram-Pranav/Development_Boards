See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

so based on clock03, so far the best README in this clock61 directory

Uses pa0 through 7 and pa9, so no uart tx.  Not sure why yet but the
high interrupt rate was causing uart reception problems, perhaps
no fifo or I didnt enable it.  Bumping the internal clock to 48 from
8 allows this to work.  Less time in the isr, isr rate relative to
number of clocks can go way down.
