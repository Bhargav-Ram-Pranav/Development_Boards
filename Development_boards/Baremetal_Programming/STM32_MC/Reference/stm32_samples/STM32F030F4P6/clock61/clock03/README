See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.


so based on clock01, so far the best README in this clock61 directory

changed the orientation so it matches how it looks in kicad.

changed it to use pa0 through pa7 and pa9, so they are all on the same
port.

This means no uart tx.  And so use the swd/jtag to program the part.

Should have and may still go back and re-do all of these examples with
the as designed orientation and only using one port.
