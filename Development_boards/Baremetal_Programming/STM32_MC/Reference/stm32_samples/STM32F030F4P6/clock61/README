See the clock01 README for now.  This is a charlieplexed clock board
60 leds in a circle driven by 9 pins.  One high one low and the rest
floating can isolate and drive one led.  To have more than one led
"on" at a time you have to blink them faster than a human can detect.
This is not very difficult a task.

The pcb is actually software created, I didnt creat this by hand
using kicad I simply looked at the file format and wrote a program
to generate everything, a little high school math.

This file is a version 4 format kicad file which happenes to be fine
on the computer I developed this on likewise after a problem at
oshpark with this board and or having nothing to do with this board
but the panel that the first one was on, they are able to build using
this file.

(kicad_pcb (version 4) (host pcbnew 4.0.7-e2-6376~58~ubuntu16.04.1)

I am going to go back and change the program to build for version 3,
so more folks can open this file with kicad, very subtle differences
in the file format.

Note I screwed up and the text clock61 was on the back copper layer
not back silkscreen.

clock01 is working!!!  I think I see an led glitch sometimes, I would
really rather use one port not two, so if I dont use the jtag/swd
then I can do that.  Also technically I have it oriented wrong.  Can
fix that.

clock02 is working!!!.  spinner02 and clock02 I changed the orientation
to be as designed when viewed in kicad.  And only uses port A, but that
means the uart TX is consumed, no uart output for debugging.
